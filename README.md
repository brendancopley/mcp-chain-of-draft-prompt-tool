# MCP Chain of Draft (CoD) Prompt Tool

[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/@brendancopley/mcp-chain-of-draft-prompt-tool)](https://smithery.ai/server/@brendancopley/mcp-chain-of-draft-prompt-tool)

## Overview

The MCP Chain of Draft (CoD) Prompt Tool is a powerful Model Context Protocol tool that enhances LLM reasoning by transforming standard prompts into either Chain of Draft (CoD) or Chain of Thought (CoT) format. Here's how it works:

1. **Input Transformation**: Your regular prompt is automatically transformed into a CoD/CoT format
2. **LLM Processing**: The transformed prompt is passed to your chosen LLM (Claude, GPT, Ollama, or local models)
3. **Enhanced Reasoning**: The LLM processes the request using structured reasoning steps
4. **Result Transformation**: The response is transformed back into a clear, concise format

This approach significantly improves reasoning quality while reducing token usage and maintaining high accuracy.

## BYOLLM Support

This tool supports a "Bring Your Own LLM" approach, allowing you to use any language model of your choice:

### Supported LLM Integrations
- **Cloud Services**
  - Anthropic Claude
  - OpenAI GPT models
  - Mistral AI
- **Local Models**
  - Ollama (all models)
  - Local LLama variants
  - Any model supporting chat completion API

### Configuring Your LLM

1. **Cloud Services**
   ```bash
   # For Anthropic Claude
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
   
   # For OpenAI
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
   
   # For Mistral AI
   export MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

2. **Local Models with Ollama**
   ```bash
   # First install Ollama
   curl https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
   
   # Pull your preferred model
   ollama pull llama2
   # or
   ollama pull mistral
   # or any other model
   
   # Configure the tool to use Ollama
   export MCP_LLM_PROVIDER=ollama
   export MCP_OLLAMA_MODEL=llama2  # or your chosen model
   ```

3. **Custom Local Models**
   ```bash
   # Point to your local model API
   export MCP_LLM_PROVIDER=custom
   export MCP_CUSTOM_LLM_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:your_port
   ```

## Credits

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Configure API keys in `.env` file:
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
4. Run the server:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

### JavaScript/TypeScript Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies using yarn (recommended) or npm:
   ```bash
   # Using yarn (recommended)
   yarn install

   # Using npm
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure API keys in `.env` file:
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
4. Build and run the server:
   ```bash
   # Build TypeScript files using Nx
   yarn nx build
   # or npm run nx build

   # Start the server
   yarn start
   # or npm start

   # For development with auto-reload:
   yarn dev
   # or npm run dev
   ```

Available scripts:
- `yarn nx build`: Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript using Nx build system
- `yarn build:sea`: Creates Single Executable Applications for all platforms
- `yarn start`: Runs the compiled server from `dist`
- `yarn test`: Runs the test query against the server
- `yarn dev`: Runs the TypeScript server directly using ts-node (useful for development)

The project uses Nx as its build system, providing:
- Efficient caching and incremental builds
- Cross-platform build support
- Integrated SEA generation
- Dependency graph visualization
- Consistent build process across environments

## Single Executable Applications (SEA)

This project supports building Single Executable Applications (SEA) using Node.js 22+ and the [@getlarge/nx-node-sea](https://github.com/getlarge/nx-node-sea) plugin. This allows you to create standalone executables that don't require Node.js to be installed on the target system.

### Building SEA Executables

The project includes several scripts for building SEA executables:

```bash
# Build for all platforms
yarn build:sea

# Build for specific platforms
yarn build:macos   # macOS
yarn build:linux   # Linux
yarn build:windows # Windows
```

### SEA Build Configuration

The project uses Nx for managing the build process. The SEA configuration is handled through the nx-node-sea plugin, which provides a streamlined way to create Node.js single executable applications.

Key features of the SEA build process:
- Cross-platform support (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- Automatic dependency bundling
- Optimized binary size
- No runtime dependencies required

### Using SEA Executables

Once built, the SEA executables can be found in the `dist` directory. These executables:
- Are completely standalone
- Don't require Node.js installation
- Can be distributed and run directly
- Maintain all functionality of the original application

For Claude Desktop integration with SEA executables, update your configuration to use the executable path:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "chain-of-draft-prompt-tool": {
            "command": "/path/to/mcp-chain-of-draft-prompt-tool",
            "env": {
                "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Claude Desktop Integration

To integrate with Claude Desktop:

1. Install Claude Desktop from [claude.ai/download](https://claude.ai/download)
2. Create or edit the Claude Desktop config file:
   ```
   ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   ```
3. Add the tool configuration (Python version):
   ```json
   {
       "mcpServers": {
           "chain-of-draft-prompt-tool": {
               "command": "python3",
               "args": ["/absolute/path/to/cod/server.py"],
               "env": {
                   "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```
   
   Or for the JavaScript version:
   ```json
   {
       "mcpServers": {
           "chain-of-draft-prompt-tool": {
               "command": "node",
               "args": ["/absolute/path/to/cod/index.js"],
               "env": {
                   "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```
4. Restart Claude Desktop

You can also use the Claude CLI to add the tool:

```bash
# For Python implementation
claude mcp add chain-of-draft-prompt-tool -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_api_key_here" "python3 /absolute/path/to/cod/server.py"

# For JavaScript implementation
claude mcp add chain-of-draft-prompt-tool -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_api_key_here" "node /absolute/path/to/cod/index.js"
```

# Create client with specific LLM provider
cod_client = ChainOfDraftClient(
    llm_provider="ollama",  # or "anthropic", "openai", "mistral", "custom"
    model_name="llama2"     # specify your model
)

# Use directly
result = await cod_client.solve_with_reasoning(
    problem="Solve: 247 + 394 = ?",
    domain="math"
)

print(f"Answer: {result['final_answer']}")
print(f"Reasoning: {result['reasoning_steps']}")
print(f"Tokens used: {result['token_count']}")
```

### JavaScript/TypeScript Client

For TypeScript/Node.js applications:

```typescript
import { ChainOfDraftClient } from './lib/chain-of-draft-client';

// Create client with your preferred LLM
const client = new ChainOfDraftClient({
  provider: 'ollama',           // or 'anthropic', 'openai', 'mistral', 'custom'
  model: 'llama2',             // your chosen model
  endpoint: 'http://localhost:11434'  // for custom endpoints
});

// Use the client
async function solveMathProblem() {
  const result = await client.solveWithReasoning({
    problem: "Solve: 247 + 394 = ?",
    domain: "math",
    max_words_per_step: 5
  });
  
  console.log(`Answer: ${result.final_answer}`);
  console.log(`Reasoning: ${result.reasoning_steps}`);
  console.log(`Tokens used: ${result.token_count}`);
}

solveMathProblem();
```

## Implementation Details

The server is available in both Python and JavaScript implementations, both consisting of several integrated components:

### Python Implementation

1. **AnalyticsService**: Tracks performance metrics across different problem domains and reasoning approaches
2. **ComplexityEstimator**: Analyzes problems to determine appropriate word limits
3. **ExampleDatabase**: Manages and retrieves examples, transforming CoT examples to CoD format
4. **FormatEnforcer**: Ensures reasoning steps adhere to word limits
5. **ReasoningSelector**: Intelligently chooses between CoD and CoT based on problem characteristics

### JavaScript Implementation

1. **analyticsDb**: In-memory database for tracking performance metrics
2. **complexityEstimator**: Analyzes problems to determine complexity and appropriate word limits
