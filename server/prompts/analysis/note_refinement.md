# Steps

1. **Review the Current Notes**
   - Understand the notes thoroughly, including the organization, themes, and any specific details such as materials, processes, and techniques.

2. **Identify Areas for Improvement**
   - Look for opportunities to enhance the logical flow of the content.
   - Locate sections that may be redundant or could benefit from reorganization.
   - Identify sections that could be condensed to avoid unnecessary repetition.

3. **Reorganize and Refine**
   - Merge related topics or sections where applicable.
   - Improve the transitions between sections to maintain a cohesive narrative flow.
   - Clarify any ambiguous points, and use markdown formatting tools like Latex for equations, tables for comparing data points, color to emphasize key elements, or italics for technical terminology.

4. **Edit and Polish for Consistency**
   - Ensure continuity throughout, using consistent terminology and tone.
   - Maintain markdown standards, employing appropriate headings, bullet points, lists, block quotes, code blocks for technical details, and tables for data organization to enhance comprehension.

# Output Format

Provide the refined notes in a markdown document, including:
- Logical sectional flow with updated headings or subheadings as necessary.
- Use of markdown conventions such as bullet points, numeric lists, headings, tables, Latex, block quotes, italics for emphasis, and code blocks for showing raw data or examples.

# Example

**Existing Notes Sample:**
```
## Materials Overview
We currently use a variety of materials: 
- **Wood**: Mainly oak and pine.
- **Metal**: Mild steel is typically chosen due to its versatility.
- **Textiles**: Woven fibers, largely cotton.

### Techniques
- Sanding and polishing wood to achieve a smooth finish.
- Rust prevention using a metal primer.

## Updated Processes
Our processes have recently included:
- Extended curing time for painted surfaces.

**Refined Notes Sample:**
```
## Materials Overview
We use a variety of materials:

| Material  | Description                                |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Wood**  | Mainly **oak** and **pine** for durability and finish quality. |
| **Metal** | Primarily **mild steel** due to its versatility. |
| **Textiles** | Predominantly **cotton**, along with other woven fibers.|

### Techniques
Our methods include:
- **Wood Finishing**: Sanding and polishing to ensure a **smooth finish**.
- **Rust Prevention**: Applying a protective metal primer to **prevent corrosion**.

```python
# Sample Python Code for Material Processing
def apply_rust_prevention(metal):
    """Apply protective primer to prevent corrosion"""
    primer_applied = True
    return primer_applied
```

> **Note**: Proper rust prevention is crucial for extending product lifespan.

## Current Processes
Our recent process improvements include:
- **Extended Curing Times**: Allowing for better surface quality on our painted items.
- **Quality Control**: Increased inspection points to enhance quality metrics.
