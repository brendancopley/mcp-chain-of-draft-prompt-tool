Welcome to the documentation for the Claude Custom Prompts system. This documentation will help you understand, install, configure, and use the system effectively.

## Overview

Claude Custom Prompts is a full-stack application designed to manage and serve custom prompt templates for Claude AI models. It consists of:

1. A Node.js server that manages prompts and communicates with Claude
